task 1.1 
there was not really any challenge as each of the new object created had there own separate values. when two instances are created, and incremented, it does not affect other instances


task 2.2
creating a prototype is alot easier to be done, there no need to modify the function created initially, all that needed to be done is to add a the method to the prototype it can be accessed from other instances created

task 3.2
after creating the two counters, each of the instances created needs to have a separate count variabe to increase or decrease without affecting the other instances created

task 6.3
The differences between counter.increment() and counter.add(1) is that, counter.increment() increases the count variable by one, and the value of count is updated to reflect that increment. while the and counter.add(1) only adds the value passed to the count variable and returns the result, the count variable remains the same
